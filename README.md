# Juicebox-OpenEVSE LED Adapter

This printed circuit board design adapts the OpenEVSE v1 Juicebox replacement board's 
LED connector to work with the LED harnesses in later model eMotorwerks Juicebox units.

Prior to the acquisition of eMotorwerks by EnelX, many (most?) Juicebox units were provided 
with LED harnesses requiring +5V power to each LED with a common ground return path (-+++).
However, early designs of the OpenEVSE replacement board were designed based on 
earlier model Juiceboxes with LED harnesses requiring a single common +5V power input and 
a ground trace to each LED (+---).  This project aims to bridge the gap between these earlier 
model OpenEVSE boards and later model Juicebox LED harnesses.
